# Company comparable analysis

## Part I

1. Select a minimum of ten firms operating in a similar industry (e.g., SaaS, etc.).

2. Obtain data from Compustat using the program provided in class.

3. Prepare tables like the one below. 

4. Identify the top and bottom firms in terms of ROE. For each of these firms:

  1. Explain the factors that led to the extreme ROE. For example, you might conclude that poor asset management (e.g., Days sales outstanding is high) is a cause.  This will require you to compute additional ratios to support your answers (e.g., days sales outstanding).

  2. For areas you identify as unusual (in 4.1), prepare a table that reports the relevant ratios for the past 16 quarters. Comment on trends (either favorable or unfavorable).

Comment on whether you expect these firms to revert to the mean over time (i.e., do you expect the poorest performing firm to improve over time?).

## Part II – Stock Recommendation – Fundamental Analysis

1. For each of the firms in our sample, compute the following:

  A. P /E Ratio

  B. Return on Invested Capital

  C. Economic Earnings Per Share

  D. Free Cash Flow Yield

  E. Price to Economic Book Value

2. Using only the P/E ratio, identify the most underpriced and overpriced security in your sample (for those with positive E).

3. Based strictly on measures b-e (combined), recommend the firm in your sample you would short and the firm you would buy.

4. Based on measures b-e (combined), and any additional “soft” information and ratio analysis, recommend the firm you would short and the firm you would buy.
 
Submit your analysis in PowerPoint and be prepared to discuss on the last day of class.

Your final submission should include a zip file with the following:

1. Python notebook

2. Excel Workbook (if you used excel to create tables).

3. PowerPoint Presentation.
